Deckdown
========

Deckdown is a totally new way to build a slide deck. You write markdown, and deckdown gives you a presentation. No BS, or JS, or HTML...

##Usage

Tell deckdown the url of your raw `.md` file by passing it as the `src` parameter, like this: 

```
http://deckdown.herokuapp.com/deck?src=path/to/yourdeck.md
```

For example, here's a slideshow version of the [deckdown readme](http://deckdown.herokuapp.com/deck?src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alanguir/deckdown/master/README.md#/).

##Caveats

Deckdown is still in an early experimental state. Feel free to use it for your presentations if you wish, just know that the service will likely change in the future.
