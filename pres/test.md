# express-pouchdb

> An Express submodule with a CouchDB style REST interface to PouchDB.

## Introduction

The **express-pouchdb** module is a fully qualified [Express](http://expressjs.com/) application with routing defined to 
mimic most of the [CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/) REST API, and whose behavior is handled by 
[PouchDB](http://pouchdb.com/). The intention is for **express-pouchdb** to be mounted into other Express apps for 
extended usability. A simple example of this is [pouchdb-server](https://github.com/nick-thompson/pouchdb-server), 
which is primarily used as a quick-and-dirty drop-in replacement for CouchDB in Node.js.

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install express-pouchdb
```

## Example Usage

Here's a sample Express app, which we'll name `app.js`.

```javascript
var express = require('express')
  , app     = express()
  , PouchDB = require('pouchdb');

app.use(express.logger('tiny'));
app.use('/db', require('express-pouchdb')(PouchDB));

app.listen(3000);
```

Now we can run this little guy and find each of `express-pouch`'s routes at the `/db` prefix.

```bash
$ node app.js &
$ curl http://localhost:3000/db/
GET / 200 56 - 7 ms
{
  "express-pouchdb": "Welcome!",
  "version": "0.2.0"
}
```

*Note,* **express-pouchdb** bundles its own JSON parsing middleware which conflicts with 
[`express.bodyParser()`](http://expressjs.com/api.html#bodyParser). Please avoid using `express.bodyParser()`. Rather,
you can use `express.urlencoded()` and `express.multipart()` alongside the **express-pouchdb** JSON middleware 
and you should find the results to be the same as you would have expected with `express.bodyParser()`.

```javascript
app.use(express.urlencoded());
app.use(express.multipart());
app.use(require('express-pouchdb')(require('pouchdb')));
```

### Using your own PouchDB

Since you pass in the `PouchDB` that you would like to use with express-pouchb, you can drop
express-pouchdb into an existing Node-based PouchDB application and get all the benefits of the HTTP interface without having to change your code.

```js
var express = require('express')
  , app     = express()
  , PouchDB = require('pouchdb');

app.use('/db', require('express-pouchdb')(PouchDB));

var myPouch = new PouchDB('foo');

// myPouch is now modifiable in your own code, and it's also
// available via HTTP at /db/foo
```

### PouchDB defaults

**Warning: this feature will be added in PouchDB 3.0.0. Use the PouchDB master branch if you can't wait.**

When you use your own PouchDB code in tandem with express-pouchdb, the `PouchDB.defaults()` API can be very convenient for specifying some default settings for how PouchDB databases are created.

For instance, if you want to use an in-memory [MemDOWN](https://github.com/rvagg/memdown)-backed pouch, you can simply do:

```js
var InMemPouchDB = PouchDB.defaults({db: require('memdown')});

app.use('/db', require('express-pouchdb')(InMemPouchDB));

var myPouch = new InMemPouchDB('foo');
```

Similarly, if you want to place all database files in a folder other than the `pwd`, you can do:

```js
var TempPouchDB = PouchDB.defaults({prefix: '/tmp/my-temp-pouch/'});

app.use('/db', require('express-pouchdb')(TempPouchDB));

var myPouch = new TempPouchDB('foo');
```

## Contributing

Want to help me make this thing awesome? Great! Here's how you should get started.

1. Because PouchDB is still developing so rapidly, you'll want to clone `git@github.com:daleharvey/pouchdb.git`, and run `npm link` from the root folder of your clone.
2. Fork **express-pouchdb**, and clone it to your local machine.
3. From the root folder of your clone run `npm link pouchdb` to install PouchDB from your local repository from Step 1.
4. `npm install`

Please make your changes on a separate branch whose name reflects your changes, push them to your fork, and open a pull request!

For commit message style guidelines, please refer to [PouchDB CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Fauxton

The custom Fauxton theme, with the PouchDB Server name and logo, are kept [in a Fauxton fork](https://github.com/nolanlawson/couchdb-fauxton) for the time being.
