##My Name is B. Carlson Esquire

##Life as a Dog
My life is incredibly *challenging*.

##Life as a Dog
My humans sometimes feed me, but mostly they 

let me ~~wither away~~ starve.

##Life as a Dog
One day, when I'm in charge, there will be never-ending amounts of food all throughout the land.

##Plan for world domination

1. Get free from the humans
2. Eat **all** of the food
3. Success
