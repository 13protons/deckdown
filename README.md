Write markdown, get a slide deck. No BS. 

##Vision

This should be a simple tool that allows you to create a slide-deck type of presentation without using slideware. There is a focus on fewer features/more utility. Transitions on a single slide will not be implemented, for example. 

Using markdown will make it possible for a whole deck to exist as a simple text file. Perforance should be such that parsing 100-200 slides takes < 2 seconds, client side. Node should be able to cross-compile a template and markdown file into a single webpage. 

I want to love revel.js, but I don't want to write html to make a slide deck. I just don't.
